Reflection

1. Afer hearing about react so often while studying ruby on the rails, I decided to spend a weekend building a fun project using react and three.js. I was honestly surprised at how readable the code was and how plug in play it seemed to be, specifically the ability to import so many useful methods from reacts library.
2. I found that using 3d models in your website is not necessarily as difficult as I believed, as there are websites with libaries of free 3d models one can use.
3. I can use my experience with the 3d modeling software Blender to make my own 3d models.
